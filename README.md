InboxPilot Lite is a production-minded support copilot that classifies customer messages, triages IT-style tickets, drafts helpful replies, and gives operations visibility through a live dashboard.

It is designed for real-world reliability:
- Uses a **local LM Studio model** for richer AI output.
- Falls back to a deterministic **RulesClassifier** when LM output is unavailable/invalid.
- Includes request tracing, metrics, rate limiting, persistence, tests, and CI.
- Supports a **vendor-agnostic IT ticket triage flow** (`/tickets/triage`) so platform adapters (Zendesk/Freshdesk/etc.) can be added later.

## What This Solves

Support teams lose time triaging repetitive inbound messages. InboxPilot Lite helps by:
- Auto-classifying intent (`question | complaint | sales | spam | other`)
- Suggesting response drafts
- Prioritizing and routing with `/copilot`
- Tracking quality/latency and recent activity in a dashboard

```

## Human Review Policy

- `needs_review=true` when confidence is below `REVIEW_THRESHOLD` (default `0.70`).
- Severe complaint language (for example: `chargeback`, `legal`, `lawsuit`, `fraud`, `bank`) is escalated to review even with high confidence.
- Reviewers resolve items through `POST /review/{request_id}` with final category and reply.

## Reliability and Fallback Behavior

- If LM Studio returns extra text or multiple JSON objects, the backend extracts the first valid JSON object.
- If output is malformed or required fields are missing, the service logs the reason and falls back to `RulesClassifier`.
- If LM Studio is unreachable, classification and copilot drafting continue with deterministic fallbacks.

## Testing and Quality

Run tests:
```bash
pytest -q
```

Run lint/format checks:
```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
```

## Design Trade-offs

These decisions were made deliberately — each one is a known trade-off, not an oversight.

| Decision | What was chosen | What was ruled out | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AI provider** | LM Studio (local model) | OpenAI / Anthropic API | Keeps the project fully runnable at zero cost. The OpenAI-compatible client means swapping to a real API is a one-line env change. |
| **Authentication** | None | JWT / API keys | This is a portfolio project demonstrating AI triage logic, not an auth system. Adding auth would obscure the actual focus. |
| **Metrics storage** | In-memory counters | Prometheus / external TSDB | There is no persistent traffic to measure. In-memory is honest for a local demo; the `/metrics` endpoint is structured so a Prometheus exporter could be dropped in. |
| **Database** | SQLite (stdlib) | PostgreSQL / managed DB | Zero infrastructure cost, zero setup friction. The db layer is isolated in `app/db.py` so a swap is straightforward. |
| **Deployment** | Local only | Render / Fly.io / Railway | No spend. The Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` mean it is ready to deploy the moment that changes. |
| **Ticket provider** | MockTicketProvider | Zendesk / Freshdesk | Demonstrates the abstraction pattern (`TicketProvider` protocol) without coupling to a paid SaaS account. |

## Roadmap

1. Add authentication and role-based dashboard access.
2. Add Prometheus/OpenTelemetry for richer production observability.
3. Add async queue processing for large batch requests.
4. Add human-in-the-loop review mode and feedback learning loop.
5. Add deploy templates for Render/Fly.io/Azure.
